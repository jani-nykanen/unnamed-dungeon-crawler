[You can play the prototype by clicking this sentence](https://jani-nykanen.github.io/unnamed-dungeon-crawler/)

This was supposed to be a 2D dungeon crawler arcade hack-n-slash roguelite, but I lost motivation to work on it. 

## Building

## License

I... don't know. Feel free to use the terrible code in any way you want, just don't claim that you wrote it yourself. Please don't use the asset files (although I can't stop you, can I?).
